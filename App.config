This program monitors Teslagrad saved games and issues split hotkeys to time splitting programs
when specific events are completed, based on criteria in this config.

SaveGamePath is the path to the Teslagrad saved games directory.
 Typically located in C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\LocalLow\Rain\Teslagrad\
 
SplitHotkey is the button press this program will send upon detecting a split.
 The list of valid key codes is:

SplitList is the sequence of events which will make the program send the SplitHotkey to your time splitting program.
There are a few limitations:
* There is no method for splitting upon starting a new game at the opening cutscene.
  The game makes its first save at the end of the opening cutscene when the door opens.
  To split at the door opening, use the following event:
  openBarriers: 0
  
* There is no method for splitting upon killing the King.
  The game does not make a save until after the crown is used.
  The game will only save after the 15-scroll ending or during the 36-Scroll endgame.
  
* There is no method for splitting upon reaching the Ende cutscene.
  However, If you press Enter at the Ende to go back to the title screen,
  the following event is generated, which you can use for splitting:
  gameComplete: 1
  
Here are the following events you can use in SplitList:

* sceneIndex: ###
  This is the room number you are currently in.
  Use a specific sceneIndex to split upon entering that room.
  
* checkpointIndex: ##
  This is the checkpoint number within your current room.
  Use a specific checkpointIndex to split upon attaining it.
  
* Scene: ### CheckPoint: ##
  A combination of sceneIndex and checkpointIndex.
  This will split on the specified scene AND checkpoint.
  
* orbsFound: xxxxxxxx
  This is the code for the current list of collected scrolls.
  If you know the specific code to watch for, this will split upon attaining it.
  
* ScrollCount: ##
  While collecting scrolls, a program counter will increment.
  This will split when the total collected reaches the listed number.
  
* CollectScroll
  This will split when the scroll counter increases.
  
* openBarriers: ########
  This is the hash for the list of opened doors.
  If you know the specific hash to watch for, this will split upon attaining it.

* openBarriers: 0
  This value is briefly set at the beginning of the game at the end of the opening cutscene.
  Start with this at the beginning of your split list if you want to start the timer automatically.

* BarrierChange
  This will split when openBarriers changes its value.
  
* glove: 1
  This will split upon collecting the glove.
  
* blink: 1
  This will split upon collecting the boots.
  
* suit: 1
  This will split upon collecting the cloak.
  
* staff: 1
  This will split upon collecting the staff.
  
* defeatedBosses: 1
  This will split when Fernus is defeated.
  
* defeatedBosses: 3
  This will split when Faradeus is defeated.
  
* defeatedBosses: 7
  This will split when Oleg is defeated.
  
* defeatedBosses: 15
  This will split when Guerickes Orb is defeated.
  
* gameComplete: 1
  This will split upon returning to the main menu after the Ende.
